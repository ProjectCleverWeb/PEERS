### 0.1.0 Rules

For line indentation you MUST use 1 tab for each indentation. This does not
apply to any indentation after the first non-whitespace character.

Any type of indentation that occures after the first non-whitespace character
MUST use spaces. If you are indenting after the first non-whitespace character
you MUST align them either with the surrounding indentations or to either a
2 or 4 wide indentation size.

### 0.1.1 Why

In most IDE's, including Vim, you can set the tab width. This means, that if
you prefer 4 spaces, 2 spaces, or another indentation size, you can view and
edit each document in your prefered width.

### 0.1.2 The Effect On Comment Columns

In most cases, tabs for indentation will not have any effect on your code
comments. However, if there is a case where your code comments are effected,
it is RECOMMENDED that you align your comments as if the document used 2 space
indentation.
