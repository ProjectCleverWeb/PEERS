###PHP Easy Efficiency &amp; Readability Standards (PEERS)

This is a quick-apply coding standard, based around the fundamentals of keeping
everything easy to read while not wasting time typing lots of extra characters.

##Status: Being Written

---

Each standard serves a logical purpose and is modular, meaning can you use PEERS as a
whole or pick-and-choose groups of "sub-standards".

There are 6 standards plus 1 alternative standard that can be applied to some or all
of the other standards. They are as follows:

- PEERS-0 (Character Placement)
- PEERS-1 (Naming Conventions)
- PEERS-2 (Autoloading)
- PEERS-3 (Child Languages)
- PEERS-4 (Paradigms)
- PEERS-5 (Commenting and Logging)
- PEERS-a (Alternatives)

###Referencing Standards

**All Standards**<br>
If you are applying all of the standards to a project, the easiest way it to just use
`PEERS` as the reference. However, this may be confusing those who are not familiar
with the standards; so despite the redundancy, it is recommended that you use
`PEERS Standards` as the reference.

**Specific Standards**<br>
If you are selective in what standards you wish to apply, you should be referencing
them accordingly. If you were only using standards 0, 1, and 4, you would reference
them as `PEERS Standards 0, 1, and 4`, `PEERS-014` or as
`PEERS-0, PEERS-1, and PEERS-4`.

**Alternative Standards**<br>
Finally, if you want to use the alternatives of the standards, you would suffix the
standard's number with an `a` or `A`, both are correct.

For example, if I wanted to use standards 0 &amp; 4 normally, but I wanted to use
the alternative standard 1, I would reference them as `PEERS Standards 0, 1a, and 4`,
`PEERS-01a4` or as `PEERS-0, PEERS-1a, and PEERS-4`.

###Quick Integration

Each standard has a summery page in the root of this reposiory, and each summery is
is meant to help you understand the basics of each standard without bogging you down
with overly specific information, egde-case scenarios, or overly verbose explinations.

The catch is that some parts of each standard may be ommited entirely. These parts
still apply to the standard, and are only ommited to save time as they are a part of
an "edge case" or are simply rarely an issue.

Additionally, the full documentation has extended examples for each section of each
standard. So if something is not clear in the summery, you will always have more
examples to browse in the full documentaion.

###Extended Information

For information beyond the basics, each standard has a dedicated directory for its'
content. Each directory has 1 main file labeled as
`<standard_number>.0-<standard_name>` plus 1 file for each section of the standard,
labeled as `<standard_number>.<section number>-<section_name>`.

For example, if we are trying to look at PEERS-3 Section 2; we would find that file
at `/PEERS-3/3.2-CSS.md`

These documents are provided to clear up any questions that may arise, and much more
verbose in their descriptions &amp; examples.

The catch is that this documentation is a small book in its' own right, and can take
a while to read completely and understand.


###Alternative Standards

Included with the main standards, is a set of alternative standards. These standards
are largely the same as the main standards; but differ in key areas.
