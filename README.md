aka *"PHP Easy Efficiency & Readability Standards"*

&nbsp;

These are quick-apply coding standards, based around the fundamentals of
keeping everything easy to read for everyone while not wasting time trying to
explain how to handle every edge case scenario.

## Overview

Each standard serves a logical purpose and is modular, meaning can you use
PEERS as a whole or pick-and-choose standards.

**There are 7 standards, They are as follows:**

- PEERS-0 Style Guide ([link](#))
- PEERS-1 Naming Conventions ([link](#))
- PEERS-2 Filesystem Conventions ([link](#))
- PEERS-3 Autoloading ([link](#))
- PEERS-4 Paradigms ([link](#))
- PEERS-5 Child Languages ([link](#))
- PEERS-6 Comments And Logging ([link](#))

## Getting Started

#### Learning The Standards

Standards are split into 2 parts, **The Summery** and **The Extended Documentation**.

Each standard has a summery file in its' directory. It is recommended that you
start with reading each of the summeries that apply to your project; and then
if you are not sure about a part (or parts) of a standard, read the extended
documentation files that apply to those parts of the standard.

This means, that you'll get the gist of the standard and be able start working
sooner. Then, when an edge case scenario comes into play, just check the
extended documentation.

#### Referencing Standards

If you're applying all of the PEER Standards, it is recommended that you
reference them with a link to this repository. **Like this:**

- This project uses [PEER Standards](https://github.com/ProjectCleverWeb/PEERS).
- This project uses [PEERS](https://github.com/ProjectCleverWeb/PEERS).

Alternatively, if you are only using specific standards, it is recommended that
you link the specific standards in use. **Like this:**

- This project uses PEER Standards [1](#), [3](#), and [5](#).
- This project uses [PEERS-1](#), [PEERS-3](#), and [PEERS-5](#).
- This project uses PEERS-[1](#)[3](#)[5](#).

#### Extended Documentation VS Summery

There is a carefully managed balance between what is allowed in the summery,
and what must only be in the extended documentation. In order to make the
extended documentation easier to navigate, each section of a standard is given
its' own file with its' sub-sections linked in the summery file.

This means that if you are reading the summery for a standard, and you are
confused about any section or sub-section, you can easily find a link to more
information on that section or sub-section.
